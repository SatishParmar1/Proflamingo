b) Right-left
c) Bottom-up
d) Top-down
8. What is virtual inheritance in C++?
a) C++ technique to enhance multiple inheritance
b) C++ technique to ensure that a private member of the base class can be accessed somehow
c) C++ technique to avoid multiple inheritances of classes
d) C++ technique to avoid multiple copies of the base class into children/derived class
9. What happens if the following C++ statement is compiled and executed?
int *ptr = NULL;
delete ptr;
a) The program is not semantically correct
b) The program is compiled and executed successfully
c) The program gives a compile-time error
d) The program compiled successfully but throws an error during run-time
10. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
#include <iostream> 
#include <string>
using namespace std; 
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
	char s1[6] = "Hello";
	char s2[6] = "World";
	char s3[12] = s1 + " " + s2;
	cout<<s3;
	return 0;
}
a) Hello
b) World
c) Error
d) Hello World
11. What is the difference between delete and delete[] in C++?
